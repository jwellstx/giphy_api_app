Do you life GIFs?  Well look no further! This is a GIF searching app called GIFinder.  Search for any keyword to display random gifs.  There is also a favorites bar included so you can add them to your favorites and reload them when you visit the page again!

Some challenges faced on this project was how to store the favorites and redisplay them when the user returned, how to enable the append feature and formatting a whole bunch of gifs!
